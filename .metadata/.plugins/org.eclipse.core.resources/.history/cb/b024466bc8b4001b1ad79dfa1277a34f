/*
 * Classes:
 * - represent real-world things
 * - serve the role of a software module (collections of related methods and their necessary variables)
 * 
 * As real-world representation:
 * - Each 'instance' of a class (what we refer to as an Object) represents a single 'thing'
 * - i.e. Two cars of the same make/model, but with different VINs, color, etc.
 * 
 * As a software module:
 * - Generally we only create one instance of the class at a time.
